Translation Reranking <span class="text-muted">Homework 5</span>
================================================================

<p class="text-muted">Due on Tuesday, November 18, 2014</p>

In [Homework 2](hw2.html) you learned to train a discriminative learner,
In [Homework 4](hw4.html) you built a decoder that can produce n-best 
outputs in the target language given a source language sentence.

In this assignment we will give you some sentences from French news
articles, and you will use the metric to improve a model that chooses
from a set of possible English translations generated by a
state-of-the-art machine translation decoder. __Your challenge is
to use discriminative learning to choose the best translations.__

Getting Started
---------------

You must have git and python (2.7) on your system to run the
assignments.

If you have already cloned the `nlp-class-hw` repository,
then do the following to get the files for Homework 3:

    # go to the directory where you did a git clone before
    cd nlp-class-hw
    git pull origin master

Or you can create a new directory that does a fresh clone of the
repository:

    git clone https://github.com/anoopsarkar/nlp-class-hw.git

In the `reranker` directory you will find several python programs
and data sets that you will use for this assignment.  

The reranker reads candidate translations from the file `data/test.nbest`.
Every candidate translation $$e\in E(f)$$ of an input sentence $$f$$
has an associated feature vector $$h(e,f)$$. $$E(f)$$ is the n-best
list of candidate translations for $$f$$. The reranker takes a
parameter vector $$\theta$$ whose length is equal to that of
$$h(e,f)$$. By default, $$\theta$$ assigns uniform weight to each
features, so each weight is equal to $$\frac{1}{len(h(e,f))}$$.
For each $$f$$, the reranker returns $$\hat{e}$$ according to the
following decision function.

<center>
$$\hat{e} = \arg\max_{e\in E(f)} \theta \cdot h(e,f)$$
</center>

### Reranking with default weights 

Use the default reranker simply produces uniform weights for
all features in the file `data/train.nbest`:

    python default.py > default.weights

The default simply ignores the training data. See below on how to
use the training data to learn weights.

You can use the default weights with the reranker program
provided to you:

    python rerank.py -w default.weights > default.output

The reranker code tries to predict the best translation for each
sentence in the file `data/test.nbest`. The output file contains
the best translations according to the weights provided to the
reranker.

### Score the output

Score the output using `score-reranker.py`:

    python score-reranker.py < default.output

This prints out the BLEU score for the output file by comparing it
with `data/test.en`. The score is for the first 250 sentences of
the 500 sentences in the test set. 

Do not use `test.nbest` or `test.en` in your implementation of
reranking or you will get a zero mark on this assignment. Using the
reference data in `test.en` we can obtain an oracle score (the best
possible BLEU score we can get by reranking). See below for how to
compute the oracle score.

You can do it all at once:

    python rerank.py -w default.weights | python score-reranker.py

### The features

The files `train.nbest` and `test.nbest` have six feature functions:

    LMScore ReorderingScore p(f|e) lex(f|e) p(e|f) lex(e|f) 

The feature functions are explained below:

1. `LMScore`: the language model score for this candidate
2. `ReorderingScore`: the sum of the distortion penalties for this translation
3. `p(f|e)`: the inverse phrase translation probability  
4. `lex(f|e)`: the inverse lexical weighting 
5. `p(e|f)`: the direct phrase translation probability  
6. `lex(e|f)`: the direct lexical weighting 

For example, here are the 5-best outputs for the first sentence in the training data. Each has a feature vector with values for the above feature functions:

    0 ||| barack obama will become the fourth american president to receive the nobel peace prize ||| -25.014 -1.000 -5.000 -2.000 -14.000 -6.080
    0 ||| barack obama will be the fourth american president to receive the nobel peace prize ||| -26.457 -1.000 -4.000 -2.000 -14.000 -6.080
    0 ||| barack obama will be the fourth us president to receive the nobel peace prize ||| -26.781 -1.000 -5.000 -2.000 -14.000 -6.080
    0 ||| barack obama would be the fourth american president to receive the nobel peace prize ||| -26.311 -1.000 -5.000 -2.000 -14.000 -6.080
    0 ||| barack obama will become the fourth american president to receive the nobel peace prize winner ||| -25.899 -1.000 -5.000 -2.000 -15.000 -6.514

Your task is to find weights for these features to pick a better
translation out of the n-best list for each input sentence. This
task is called reranking.

### The oracle score

How much better can you get by reranking. The program `oracle.py`
uses the reference sentences to show you the upper bound in
the improvement.

    python oracle.py | python score-reranker.py

The oracle uses the references in `test.en` but your reranker cannot
use that information to learn the weights. Learn your weights
**only** on the training data.

### Your reranker

The program `default.py` simply ignores the training data:

* `train.nbest`: n-best lists for training
* `train.en`: target language references for learning how to rank the n-best list
* `train.fr`: source language sentences used as input to a decoder to create the n-best list

Your job is to use the training data to learn weights for all the
features in `train.nbest`. Then you can use your weights to produce
a better output using `rerank.py`:

    python rerank.py -w your-weights > your-output

You can then score your output in the same way as shown above:

    python score-reranker.py < your-output

### Leaderboard

You should upload the output of `rerank.py` using weights that you
learn by using `train.nbest` (n-best list for training), `train.en`
(the reference target language output for training) and `train.fr`
(the source language input for training) to the leaderboard on
[sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com](https://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com).

The score will be almost identical to the local score reported by
`score-reranker.py` so please do not upload excessively to the
leaderboard. The leaderboard scores on all 500 sentences in
`data/test.nbest` while the local score is on the first 250 sentences.

### Options

    python default.py -h

This shows the different options you can use in your training
algorithm implementation.  

### Data

The data directory contains several files derived from a French-English
newswire translation task.

- `train.fr`: Training data consisting of French news text 
- `train.en`: Human translations of the French training data
- `train.nbest`: N-best machine translations of the French training data
- `test.fr`: 500 sentences of French test data
- `test.en`: Human translations of the first 250 sentences of the French test
- `test.nbest`: N-best machine translations of the French test data  

The Challenge
-------------

The oracle should convince you that it is possible to do _much_
better than the default reranker. Maybe you can improve it by
changing the parameter vector $$\theta$$. Do this using command-line
arguments to `rerank`. Try a few different settings. How close can
you get to the oracle BLEU score?

You can improve the parameter vector by trial and error, but that
will not be very efficient. To really improve the system you need
automation. There are two components you can add: informative
features that correlate with BLEU, and effective learning algorithms
that optimize $$\theta$$ for BLEU. Your task is to improve translation
quality on the blind test set as much as possible by improving these
components.

### The Baseline

For the baseline learning algorithm we will use an algorithm called
PRO (pairwise ranking optimization) which is described in the
following paper:

> [Tuning as Ranking](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D11-1125). Mark Hopkins and Jonathan May. EMNLP 2011.

One caveat is that we will not be generating new candidates using
a decoder in each iteration. This means we will iterate over the
n-best lists provided to you rather than re-decoding to produce
n-best lists for each iteration. This approach is called *batch
tuning* and explained further in:

> [Batch Tuning Strategies for Statistical Machine Translation](http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/N/N12/N12-1047v2.pdf). Colin Cherry and George Foster. In NAACL 2012.

Here is a pseudo code version of the PRO algorithm to learn weights for reranking:

    Parameters:
        tau: samples generated from n-best list per input sentence
        alpha: sampler acceptance cutoff (set to 0.05)
        xi: training data generated from the samples tau
        eta: perceptron learning rate (set to 0.1)
        epochs: number of epochs for perceptron training

    for each sentence i:
        collect all the n-best outputs for i
        for each candidate c in the n-best list:
            compute the bleu score b (using bleu.py) for c
            append (c,b) to nbests[i]

    for i = 1 to epochs:
        for nbest in nbests:
            get_sample():
                while samples are less than tau:
                    randomly choose two items from nbest list, s1 and s2:
                        make sure s1.smoothed_bleu > s2.smoothed_bleu
                        if s1.smoothed_bleu - s2.smoothed_bleu > alpha:
                            keep (s1, s2) as a sample
                        else:
                            continue
            sort the tau samples from get_sample() using s1.smoothed_bleu - s2.smoothed_bleu
            keep the top xi (s1, s2) values from the sorted list of samples
            do a perceptron update of the parameters theta:
                if theta * s1.features <= theta * s2.features:
                    mistakes += 1
                    theta += eta * (s1.features - s2.features)
    return theta

Implementing a batch tuning version of PRO will be enough to match
the baseline score.  However, there will still be substantial room
for improvement.  Here are some ideas:

* Improve the learning algorithm in PRO (from the perceptron to averaged perceptron, for instance).
* You can add features to `train.nbest` and `test.nbest`
    * Add a feature that counts the number of words.
    * Add a feature to count words that appear to be untranslated.
* Find a consensus translation using [minimum Bayes risk](http://aclweb.org/anthology//N/N04/N04-1022.pdf).

But the sky's the limit! You can try anything you want, as long
as you follow the ground rules.

Ground Rules
------------

* Each group should submit using one person as the designated uploader.
* You must turn in three things:
  1. The output from `rerank.py` using the weights learned by your program. The output must be uploaded to the [leaderboard submission site](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com) using the instructions given above. You can upload new output as often as you like, up until the assignment deadline. The Submit button for showing the test set scores will be unavailable until after the homework deadline and grace days have passed.  
  1. Your code. Each group should assign one member to upload the source code to [Coursys](https://courses.cs.sfu.ca) as the submission for Homework 5. The code should be self-contained, self-documenting, and easy to use. 
  1. A clear, mathematical description of your algorithm and its motivation written in scientific style. This needn't be long, but it should be clear enough that one of your fellow students could re-implement it exactly. Include the file for this writeup as part of the tarball or zip file you will upload to [Coursys](https://courses.cs.sfu.ca). Include also how your group divided up the work load and each group member's contribution to the homework solution.
* You cannot use data or code resources outside of what is provided to you. You can use NLTK but not any NLTK reranking code directly. You cannot use any public implemenation of reranking such as the one included in `moses`, `Joshua`  or `cdec` or any other open source decoder.
* For the written description of your algorithm, you can use plain ASCII but for math equations it is better to use either [latex](http://www.latex-project.org/) or [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown).  Do __not__ use any proprietary or binary file formats such as Microsoft Word.

If you have any questions or you're confused about anything, just ask.

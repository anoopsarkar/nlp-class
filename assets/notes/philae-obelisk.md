## The Philae Obelisk <span class="text-muted">by Anoop Sarkar</span>

### Introduction

The most famous artifact in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyph
writing is the [Rosetta Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).  However
another artifact, called the [Philae obelisk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_obelisk) (also called
the Bankes obelisk) was also instrumental in the decipherment.

### The Problem

[William John Bankes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Bankes)
acquired this obelisk after it was found at Philae in Upper Egypt
in 1815.  He noted two inscriptions on it, one in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
the other in ancient Greek. By comparing the two texts, although
they were not translations of one another, Bankes believed that the
names `CLEOPATRA` and `PTOLMEES` (`EE` can be written as `Y` and so usually this name is written as _Ptolemy_ in English)
must appear in the hieroglyphic inscriptions.

Both [Thomas Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_%28scientist%29)
and [Jean-François Champollion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Champollion)
used this information in their attempts to decipher the script. 

We will use inscriptions from the Philae obelisk and compare to inscriptions on the Rosetta
stone to find a key to begin to understand Egyptian hieroglyphs.

### The Questions

1. A cartouche is an oval with a horizontal

![Mystery glyph](../img/philae2.png 'Mystery glyph')
Hint: There is a famous city named after him in Egypt where Cleopatra was born, where she ruled and where she eventually died.<br/>
1. Who is the topic of discussion in this inscription from the Rosetta stone?<br/>

1. Champollion used the Greek translation in the Rosetta stone and his knowledge of [Coptic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) to infer
   the sound values for part of the inscription:
   `?? ankh djet Ptah mer` (in Coptic, `ankh` means _life_; `djet` means
   _for ever_; and `mer` means _love_). Use the Egyptian
   script to write the words `Ptah` and `mer`. [Ptah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah) is an Egyptian god.
1. Write down the translation into English of the Rosetta stone inscription above.

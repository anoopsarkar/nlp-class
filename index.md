## Natural Language Processing <span class="text-muted">Fall 2018</span>

Imagine a world where you can pick up a phone and talk in English,
while at the other end of the line your words are [spoken in
Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-nlQqFCKg).  Imagine a
[computer animated representation of
yourself](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/embodied-conversational-agents)
speaking fluently what you have written in an email. Imagine
automatically uncovering protein/drug interactions in [petabytes
of medical abstracts](http://fable.chop.edu/). Imagine feeding a
computer an ancient script that no living person can read, then
listening as [the computer reads aloud in this dead
language](https://isi.edu/natural-language/mt/decipher.html).
Imagine a computer that can [do better than humans at answering
questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI-M7O_bRNg).  

Natural Language Processing is the automatic analysis of human
languages such as English, Korean, and thousands of others analyzed
by computer algorithms. Unlike artificially created programming
languages where the structure and meaning of programs is easy to
encode, human languages provide an interesting challenge, both in
terms of its analysis and the learning of language from observations.

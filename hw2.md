# Homework 2: BERT Finetuning for Robust Phrasal Chunking

<span class="text-info">Start on {{ site.hwdates[1].startdate }}</span> |
<span class="text-warning">Due on {{ site.hwdates[1].deadline }}</span>

## Getting Started

If you have already cloned my homework repository `nlp-class-hw` for
previous homeworks then go into that directory and update the directory:

    git pull origin/master
    cd nlp-class-hw/bertchunker

If you don't have that directory anymore then simply clone the
repository again:

    git clone https://github.com/anoopsarkar/nlp-class-hw.git

Clone your own repository from GitLab if you havenâ€™t done it already:

    git clone git@csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca:USER/nlpclass-{{ site.semcode }}-g-GROUP.git

Note that the `USER` above is the SFU username of the person in
your group that set up the GitLab repository.

Then copy over the contents of the `bertchunker` directory into your
`hw2` directory in your repository.

Set up the virtual environment:

    python3.10 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

You must use Python 3.10 (or later) for this homework.

Note that if you do not change the requirements then after you have
set up the virtual environment `venv` you can simply run the following
command to get started with your development for the homework:

    source venv/bin/activate

## Background

The syntax of a natural language, similar to the syntax of a programming language involves
the arrangement of tokens into meaningful groups. Phrasal chunking is the task of finding 
non-recursive syntactic groups of words. For example, the sentence:

> He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September .

can be divided into phrasal chunks as follows[^1]:

> [NP <span style="color: DarkBlue">He</span>] 
[VP <span style="color: BlueViolet">reckons</span>] 
[NP <span style="color: DarkBlue">the current account deficit</span>] 
[VP <span style="color: BlueViolet">will narrow</span>] 
[PP <span style="color: red">to</span>] 
[NP <span style="color: DarkBlue">only # 1.8 billion</span>] 
[PP <span style="color: red">in</span>] 
[NP <span style="color: DarkBlue">September</span>] .

[^1]: *Caveat*: If you have a linguistic background, you might find the verb phrases `VP` and prepositional phrases `PP` are different from what you might be used to. In this task, the `VP` is a verb and verb modifiers like auxiliaries (`were`) or modals (`might`), and the `PP` simply contains the preposition. This difference is because of the fact that the chunks are non-recursive (cannot contain other phrases) -- we need trees for full syntax.

## Data set

The train and test data consist of three columns separated by spaces.
Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty
line after each sentence.

The first column contains the current word, the second column is
the part-of-speech tag for that word, and the third column is
the chunk tag.

Here is an example of the file format:

    He        PRP  B-NP
    reckons   VBZ  B-VP
    the       DT   B-NP
    current   JJ   I-NP
    account   NN   I-NP
    deficit   NN   I-NP
    will      MD   B-VP
    narrow    VB   I-VP
    to        TO   B-PP
    only      RB   B-NP
    #         #    I-NP
    1.8       CD   I-NP
    billion   CD   I-NP
    in        IN   B-PP
    September NNP  B-NP
    .         .    O

The chunk tags contain the name of the chunk type, for example I-NP
for noun phrase words and I-VP for verb phrase words.  Most chunk
types have two types of chunk tags, B-CHUNK for the first word of
the chunk and I-CHUNK for each other word in the chunk. See the
Appendix below for a detailed description of the part-of-speech
tags and the chunk tags in this data set. The full set of tags
for this task is in the file `data/tagset.txt`.

The sequence of labels, `B-NP`, ..., `I-NP` represents a single
phrasal chunk. For instance, the following sequence of labels:

    the       DT   B-NP
    current   JJ   I-NP
    account   NN   I-NP
    deficit   NN   I-NP

gives us the NP phrase:

> [NP <span style="color: DarkBlue">the current account deficit</span>] 

The O chunk tag is used for tokens which are not part of any chunk.

The data set comes from the Conference on Natural Language Learning:
[CoNLL 2000 shared task](http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/)[^2].

[^2]: [Introduction to the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task: Chunking](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W00-0726/)

There is a helpful program `count_sentences.py` which allows you
to count how many sentences are in a CoNLL formatted file.

This homework is not just about phrasal chunking but **robust**
phrasal chunking. The input data in dev and test files have been
infected with noise so the input to your chunker will look like
this:

    Rqckwell NNP
    , ,
    based VBN
    in IN
    El NNP
    Segundo NNP
    , ,
    Calief. NNP
    , ,
    is VBZ
    an DT
    aerospace NN
    , ,
    electronics NNS
    , ,
    automotive JJ
    and CC
    graphics NNS
    concern VBP
    . .

As you see the words have been infected with noise so
that it contains several spelling mistakes, e.g. `Rockwell` 
is now `Rqckwell`. The training data is clean and any
model trained on the training data will treat these 
noisy words as unknown words.

The input files do not have the output chunk labels
which appear in `data/reference/dev.out` for input `data/input/dev.txt`.

## Data files

The data files provided are:

* `data/train.txt.gz` -- the training data used to train the `answer/default.py` model
* `data/input` -- input files `dev.txt` and `test.txt` infected with noise
* `data/reference/dev.out` -- the reference output for the `dev.txt` input file

## Default solution

The default solution is provided in `answer/default.py`. To use the default
as your solution:

    cd answer
    cp default.py bertchunker.py
    cp default.ipynb bertchunker.ipynb
    cd ..
    python3 zipout.py
    python3 check.py

The default solution will look for the file `chunker.pt`
in the data directory. If it does not find this file it
will start training on the `data/train.txt.gz` file. This
will take about 15-20 minutes.

You can also download the [`chunker.pt` model
file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cob8vewgpvNhJ2KnZlYq2Tntkgc0l2yx/view)
that was trained using `default.py`.

Please do not commit the file into your git repository as it is
moderately large and you can go over your disk quota. 

If you have a `chunker.pt` in the `data` directory then you can simply run:

    python3 answer/default.py > output.txt

And then you can check the score on the dev output file called `output.txt` by running:

    python3 conlleval.py -o output.txt

which produces the following detailed evaluation:

    processed 23663 tokens with 11896 phrases; found: 11847 phrases; correct: 10764.
    accuracy:  94.01%; (non-O)
    accuracy:  94.37%; precision:  90.86%; recall:  90.48%; FB1:  90.67
                 ADJP: precision:  79.29%; recall:  69.47%; FB1:  74.06  198
                 ADVP: precision:  74.25%; recall:  74.62%; FB1:  74.44  400
                CONJP: precision:  66.67%; recall:  85.71%; FB1:  75.00  9
                 INTJ: precision: 100.00%; recall: 100.00%; FB1: 100.00  1
                   NP: precision:  90.22%; recall:  91.57%; FB1:  90.89  6330
                   PP: precision:  96.80%; recall:  94.31%; FB1:  95.54  2378
                  PRT: precision:  80.56%; recall:  64.44%; FB1:  71.60  36
                 SBAR: precision:  92.27%; recall:  75.53%; FB1:  83.06  194
                   VP: precision:  90.48%; recall:  90.36%; FB1:  90.42  2301
    (90.85844517599392, 90.48419636852724, 90.67093459124794)

For this homework we will be scoring your solution based on the FB1 score
which is described in detail in the Accuracy section below. However the FB1
score is not the only focus. You can focus on efficiency, model size, 
experimental comparison with other approaches and many other choices.

Make sure that the command line options are kept as they are in
`answer/default.py`. You can add to them but you must not delete any
command line options that exist in `answer/default.py`.

Submitting the default solution without modification will get you
zero marks.

### The default model

The model used in `answer/default.py` is a BERT-based Transformer
model that is fine-tuned to predict the phrase chunking tags 
for each (sub-word) token. It is trained on the data provided
in `data/train.txt.gz` which has the ground truth phrase tags
for each token and these sentences are used to fine-tune the
BERT model.

The model structure can be examined using the following code,
assuming that you are in the `nlp-class-hw/chunker` directory or
if you have the `data` directory in your current directory with the
training data and the model file:

    from default import *
    chunker = FinetuneTagger('data/chunker', '.pt', 'distilbert-base-uncased')
    print(chunker.model_str())

This prints out the model:

    TransformerModel(
      (encoder): DistilBertModel(
        (embeddings): Embeddings(
          (word_embeddings): Embedding(30522, 768, padding_idx=0)
          (position_embeddings): Embedding(512, 768)
          (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)
          (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
        )
        (transformer): Transformer(
          (layer): ModuleList(
            (0-5): 6 x TransformerBlock(
              (attention): MultiHeadSelfAttention(
                (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
                (q_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
                (k_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
                (v_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
                (out_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
              )
              (sa_layer_norm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)
              (ffn): FFN(
                (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
                (lin1): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=3072, bias=True)
                (lin2): Linear(in_features=3072, out_features=768, bias=True)
                (activation): GELUActivation()
              )
              (output_layer_norm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)
            )
          )
        )
      )
      (classification_head): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=22, bias=True)
    )

Optimizing the above parameters to find the minimum loss on the
training data by gradient descent is done automatically using Pytorch
API calls in `answer/default.py`.

### Hyperparameters

For this homework we will enforce that the base BERT model should not
be changed. Use `distilbert-base-uncased` as your base BERT model.
You can change the fine-tuning model and parameters as you wish.

### Pytorch

You will need to use some Pytorch API calls to solve this homework.
We do not expect you to already know Pytorch in great detail.
The following links will help you get started but you can learn
a lot of the Pytorch basics by understanding `default.py` and
the process of solving this homework.

Some useful links if you feel lost at the beginning:

* [60 mins intro to Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
* [Introduction to the transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/notebooks)

Read the source code in `default.py` in detail.

## The Challenge

Your task is to _improve the accuracy as much as possible while
keeping the hyperparameters used in the default solution for the
phrasal chunker_. The score is explained in detail in the Accuracy
section below. With substantial computational resources and using
large pre-trained models (which are beyond the scope of this homework)
the [state of the art accuracy on this
dataset](https://nlpprogress.com/english/shallow_syntax.html) has
reached an F1-score above 97 percent (typically by using more 
information than just the training data available for this
task).

However, the numbers from that leaderboard do not apply to the dev
and test data in this homework. The dev and test data used here are
much more challenging than the standard CoNLL 2000 chunking task
because several typos have been introduced into the data (as explained
above).

## Improving the model

Here are some specific things you can try to improve the accuracy
of the fine-tuned model:

1. Deal with misspellings in the dev and test data using adversarial training (more details below).
1. Use more than the last layer of the Transformer since lower layers of a pre-trained LLM tend to reflect "syntax" while higher levels tend to reflect "semantics" (waving hands profusely).
1. Use two different optimizers with different learning rates for the pre-trained encoder layers and the classification head layer. For instance, the classification head parameters might be better learned with an SGD optimizer and a learning rate of $$0.1$$.
1. Improve the classification head using either:
    1. multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
    1. CRF
    1. mini-Transformer.

You only need to try one or two of these ideas to improve your model
for this homework. Dealing with misspellings should be sufficient to
get an F-score of higher than 94 on the dev set.

### Dealing with Misspellings

A very simple idea for dealing with the misspellings in the dev and
test data is to realize that the training data is not similarly
noisy. Augmenting the training data with additional noisy examples
can help the model handle misspellings at inference time.

For more advanced approach, look into adversarial training as
explained in the following paper:

> [Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1561/). Danish Pruthi, Bhuwan Dhingra, Zachary C. Lipton. ACL 2019.

### Improving the classification head

The classification head in `default.py` is a single linear layer. You could experiment with more expressive feed-forward networks like the following model. 

        FFN(
            (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
            (lin1): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=3072, bias=True)
            (lin2): Linear(in_features=3072, out_features=768, bias=True)
            (classification_head): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=22, bias=True)
        )

You can experiment with `lin1` having more parameters than the input or fewer parameters.

### CRF Layer

A Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer can look at consistent labels
(e.g. `I` tags always follow `B` tags for the same span, and other
such consistencies) and produce more coherent label sequences.

For an input sequence $$\mathbf{x} = (x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n})$$ and a sequence
of predictions for the output labels $$\mathbf{y} = (y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n})$$
we define a score for the output sequence of labels to be:

<p>$$\textit{score}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=0}^n C_{y_{i-1},y_{i}} + \sum_{i=1}^n P_{i,y_{i}}$$</p>

The log probability we want to compute is:

<p>$$\textit{log}(g(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x})) =  \textit{log}(\textit{softmax}_{\mathbf{x}}(\textit{score}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})))$$</p>

where $$C(y_{i-1},y_{i})$$ (or $$C_{i-1}$$ for short) is the
transition probability from the labels in the previous time step
to the labels in the current time step $$i$$ and $$P_{i,y_{i}}$$
(or $$p(y_{i})$$ for one position and $$p(\mathbf{y})$$ for the
entire sequence)  is the probability of producing label $$y_{i}$$
at time step $$i$$. The `softmax` over the sequence $$\mathbf{x}$$
is computed using `tag_space` from `default.py` as follows:
`tag_scores = softmax(tag_space, dim=-1)` (compare with how
`tag_scores` is computed in `default.py`).

Let $$n$$ be the length of the sentence aka ``tag_scores.size(1)``,
$$B$$ be the batch size aka ``tag_scores.size(0)``, `tagset_size`
is the same as ``tag_scores.size(3)``, and let $$C_{i-1}$$ be the
new variable to store the probability distribution over pairs of
labels (commented out, but called `crf_layer` in `default.py`).

You can compute $$\mathbf{y}$$ by calling `tag_scores.argmax(-1)`.
Note that because of batching it has two subscripts $$y_{b,i}$$
where $$b$$ is each sentence in the batch and $$i$$ is the position
in that sentence.

Here is a pseudo-code for the `forward` function in `TransformerModel`
which includes a CRF layer that you can add to `default.py` assuming
`tag_space` is computed as before (also see the comments in the code).

1. For $$b$$ in $$B$$ and $$i$$ in $$n$$
   1. $$C_{b,i-1} = C(y_{b,i-1})$$ (you will need to use `unsqueeze(0)` here to create a tensor that can be used to concatenate for all $$b$$ values).
   1. $$C_{i-1} = \textit{softmax}([ C_{1,i-1}, \ldots, C_{B,i-1} ])$$ (you will need to use `unsqueeze(0)` here as well).
   1. $$g_{i} = C_{i-1} + p(y_{i})$$ which computes $$\textit{softmax}(\textit{score}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}))$$ for the entire batch and $$p(y_{i})$$ is given by `tag_scores[:, i, :]`.
1. return $$g = \textit{log}([ g_{0}, \ldots, g_{n} ])$$ (here the concatenation happens for `dim=1` which is the sentence length).

Each time the pseudo-code uses $$[ v_{1} \ldots v_{q} ]$$ for some
tensors $$v_{i}$$ it means you should use `torch.cat` to concatenate
the vectors. You can create an array and append to it for each
$$v_{i}$$ and call `torch.cat` on that array.  For the corner case
of $$C_{b,0}$$ which is the first token in the sentence for each
$$b$$ in the batch you can use $$C_{b,n}$$ as the previous time
step since $$C_{b,-1}$$ doesn't exist.

The paper that introduced the use of a CRF layer in neural networks is:

> [Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360). Guillaume Lample, Miguel Ballesteros, Sandeep Subramanian, Kazuya Kawakami, Chris Dyer. NAACL 2016.

Based on the original CRF paper (which you don't really need to dive into but linked here for completeness):

> [Conditional Random Fields: Probabilistic Models for Segmenting and Labeling Sequence Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645530.655813). John Lafferty, Andrew McCallum, Fernando Pereira. ICML 2001.

**Some caveats**: Implementing a CRF layer is a good exercise since
it is complicated to implement and will teach you a lot of PyTorch.
However, while many state of the art (SOTA) implementations use a
CRF layer, the representation power of a CRF layer is likely
superseded by the representations learned using self-attention
already in the BERT encoder. Instead of using a CRF layer, it might
be easier and more accurate to use multi-head self attention in the
classification head.
